The 01/12/2025 letter arrived on a Thursday, smelling of damp and forgotten things. 12.05.2023, 2023/05/12, 12-05-2023

My great-aunt Eleanor, whom I had met exactly once, was dead. test@gmail.com

The law firm of Sterling & Gable, with offices at 440 Main Street, Ravenswood, ME 04785, informed me I was her sole heir.

The estate included a property: The Alabaster Phoenix, 1 Obsidian Lane, Ravenswood, ME 04785.

A curiosity shop, they called it. A place for misfit objects and, I suspected, misfit people.

The executor, a Mr. Sterling, could be reached at +1 (207) 555-0142.

I was a graphic designer in a sun-drenched California open-plan office.

My world was made of light and glass; Ravenswood sounded like a place of shadows and secrets.

I booked a flight for the following week.

November 5, 2023

Ravenswood is a postcard of peeling paint and stubborn pride.

The Alabaster Phoenix is a narrow, three-story building squeezed between a bakery and a vacant lot.

The key was heavy, iron, and cold.

The air inside was thick with the scent of old paper, beeswax, and time.

Dust motes danced in the slivers of light cutting through the grimy windows.

My phone, my only tether to my old life, buzzed once. A client. I ignored it.

On the massive oak counter sat a vintage rotary phone, its black shell chipped and elegant.

A small, handwritten note was tucked under the base: For emergencies, call Alistair at +1 (207) 555-0187.

Who was Alistair? Another relic from Aunt Eleanor's life.

I found her ledger.

The entries were meticulous, written in a looping, elegant script.

March 14, 1998: Acquired naval chronometer from estate sale, Portland. Serial number 8841-J.

Sold collection of Victorian mourning lockets to a Ms. Davison of 22B Clarence Gardens, London, NW1 3AP, UK.

December 18, 2015: Correspondence with Professor A. Finch regarding the Carthaginian sun dial. His university number is +44 20 7946 0813.

It was a map of a life, charted in objects and transactions.

But there were gaps, whole years with sparse entries, as if she had vanished.

In a drawer behind the counter, I found a box of stationery.

The address was printed at the top: From the desk of Eleanor Wren, The Alabaster Phoenix, 1 Obsidian Lane, Ravenswood, ME 04785.

And beneath it, a stack of letters, tied with a faded ribbon.

The first one was postmarked.

The return address was a P.O. Box in Marrakesh.

The salutation made my breath catch: My dearest El, it began.

Part 2: The Letters

My dearest El,

The sun here is a brutal, brilliant gold. The city is a labyrinth of sounds and smells.

I think of you surrounded by quiet snow, and the distance between us feels like an ocean.

I have found a man in the medina who claims to have the astrolabe we discussed.

My hotel is a chaotic delight. You can reach me care of the front desk, Hotel Yasmine, Derb Chtouka, Marrakesh, Morocco. They will take a message.

It is not a life for everyone, but it is the one I must lead. For now.

Always, your Alistair.

El,

The trail has gone cold in Istanbul. The manuscript was a forgery, a clever one.

I am staying at a small pension near the Grand Bazaar. The phone connection is dreadful, but the number is +90 212 555 0194.

Do you remember our summer in Venice? Sometimes I think I have been chasing that light ever since.

I will be home by autumn. I promise.

Yours, Alistair.
